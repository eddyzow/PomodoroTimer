# Pomodoro Timer
_i need to study_

## entry #1 - 6/16

i spent the last hour figuring out what i was going to use for the display, and i decided on this 4.0" TFT LCD (ST7796S) driven by an arduino nano. i then created a quick cad of the case, whuich does not contain any electronics components yet -- i will need to add the hole for the rotary encoder, buttons, power, etc. and all of it will fit inside this tight housing, likely powered by four AA batteries. if needed i will enlarge the housing. i will also add a hidden message inside / outside the case! 

tomorrow i will look at electronics and try to get some real stuff going on. i anticipate this will be a short project but i'll still learn a lot because i've never used SPI before and i've also never played with displays or buzzers before!

## entry #0 - 6/16

welcome back! it's time for my FOURTH highway project! i can't believe i'm starting another one even though none of my first three have been built yet -- shame on long wait times for project approval and shipping. :(

this time, i'll be building something really necessary for me especially as i'm going into college. introducing... the Pomodoro Timer!

if you haven't heard of the pomodoro system, you study for 25 minutes, take a 5 min break, and repeat. it's supposed to give you the best study feel, and i thought a physical device to be the timer would be intersting.

i envision getting to use the rest of my rotary encoders and extra keyboard switches to build this, so the budget will hopefully be low! there will be other modes on the timer such as 52/17 (52 min work, 17 min break) for people like me who have a hard time locking in, and when locked in, a hard time locking out (ADHD people!)

that'll be it for this entry. i'm going to begin creating my design. no PCBs - i'm just going to use a good old breadboard for this one.
